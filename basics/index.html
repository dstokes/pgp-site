<p>
  GnuPG uses a keyring to manage public and private keys. Getting familiar
  with some basic tasks is the first step in upping your PGP game.
</p>

<h3 id="public-keys">Working With Public Keys</h3>
<p>
  You need to share your public key with your colleagues before they can
  encrypt data to you. You can do so by publishing your key to a key server, or
  exporting and sending it directly to them.
</p>
<p>
  You can list your current public keys with the following command:
</p>
<pre>
$ gpg --list-keys
/path/to/home/.gnupg/pubring.gpg
--------------------------------
pub   4096R/4758CCAF 2016-01-01 [expires: 2020-01-01]
uid       [ultimate] John Doe <john@doe.com>
sub   4096R/BFD256FF 2015-10-21 [expires: 2020-01-01]
</pre>
<p>
  Note the key id of the key you want and export it a file:
</p>
<pre>$ gpg --armor --export 4758CCAF > key.pub</pre>
<p>
  Now distribute <code>key.pub</code> so others can encrypt messages to you.
</p>
