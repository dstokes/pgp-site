## Why
I created this site to try and lower the barrier of entry for participating
in secure communication. Hopefully this site can be a first stop for both
those that seek out PGP on their own, and those of use who are already familiar
with the technology and continue to funnel people towards it.

## Who
My name's Drew.

I live on the internet at <a target="_blank" href="https://drewstokes.com">https://drewstokes.com</a>.

Feel free to try out your new found PGP skills on <a target="_blank" href="https://keybase.io/dstokes">my public key</a>.
