<p>
For the purposes of simplicity on this site, we'll deal exclusively with using
the GNU open source implementation of the OpenPGP protocol, GnuPG.

<h3>Mac</h3>
<p>
Macs come with a default command-line GPG installation, but you'll want to
upgrade to GPG2 for the latest bells and whistles. The easiest way to do so is
to grab a copy of <a target="_blank" href="http://brew.sh/">Homebrew</a> and run the following:
</p>
<pre>$ brew install gpg2</pre>
<p>
If you prefer working with graphical interfaces you can install
<a target="_blank" href="https://gpgtools.org/">GPG Tools</a>.
